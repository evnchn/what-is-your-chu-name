## Additional CSS hotfix for chunithm net

If you have a üõê friend, and has a emblem net to his/her name, then for no reason the div containing this emblem has a width of 300px. 

The width has been hard-coded to force it to behave normal. This may bite in a future release, though. 

## New feature carried over from what-is-mai-name V2

Pay attention to the black header bar in the friends page. 

Normally, there is no click action involved. This is why it has now been repurposed as a button.
